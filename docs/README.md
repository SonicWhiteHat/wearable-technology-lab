## 🧠 Personal Development Track

> We believe building great technology starts with building a great human.

This track covers:
- Speed typing exercises
- Speed reading techniques
- Morning Miracle routine (based on *The Miracle Morning* book)
- Deep habit formation (*The Power of Habit*)
- Learning Linux based on your role
- Multidisciplinary skill acquisition
- Priority management (Eisenhower Matrix)
