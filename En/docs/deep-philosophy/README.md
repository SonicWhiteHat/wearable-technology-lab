## 🧬 Why Integrate Technology with Neuroscience?
- The human brain is extremely complex and highly sensitive to subtle factors.
- Early detection of stress indicators provides a real opportunity for intervention and prevention before symptoms escalate.

## 🧪 A Quantum Physics Analogy
In the double-slit experiment, simply "observing" a particle changes its behavior.  
Similarly, "observing" early physical signs of stress can alter behavioral outcomes — if timely and appropriate intervention is applied.

## 🛠️ Simple Practical Example
When elevated stress is detected (e.g., increased GSR — Galvanic Skin Response), the wearable device immediately sends a notification:

> 🛎️ "Your child may be feeling stressed. Take a moment to comfort them before it escalates."
