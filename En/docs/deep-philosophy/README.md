# 🧠 Deep Philosophy

## 🧬 Why merge technology and neuroscience?
- The human brain is extremely complex.
- Detecting early physical signs of stress enables preventative intervention.

---

## 🧪 Quantum Physics Analogy:
In the double-slit experiment, observing particles changes their behavior.  
Similarly, observing physical stress signals early can change the behavioral outcome through timely action.

---

## 🛠️ Simple Example:
Once the bracelet detects rising stress (e.g., increased GSR),  
it immediately sends an alert:  
_"Your child may be stressed. Take calming actions now to avoid escalation."_
