# 🚀 Agile Scrum Plan - Autism Smart Bracelet

## 🏗️ Methodology
We follow Scrum to manage development through:
- 2-week Sprints
- Regular events (Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, Retrospectives)

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles
- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team (Developers, Hardware Engineers, Data Analysts)

## 🛠️ Simple Example:
First Sprint:
- Connect a heart rate sensor to a microcontroller.
- Display the heart rate on a small screen.

Next Sprint:
- Add an alert system when heart rate crosses a danger threshold.

(We gradually build features sprint by sprint.)
