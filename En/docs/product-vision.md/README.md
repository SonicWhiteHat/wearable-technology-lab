# 🌟 Product Vision - Autism Smart Bracelet

## 🎯 Objective
Create a smart bracelet that detects early signs of stress in individuals with autism and alerts caregivers before behavioral outbursts occur.

## 🔥 Why is this project important?
- Stress signals appear physically several minutes before an emotional explosion.
- Early intervention reduces risks and improves the quality of life.

## 🛠️ Simple Example:
Imagine a basic smartwatch that measures your heart rate.  
Every time your heart rate exceeds 120 bpm, the watch lights up red.  
(This is how the smart bracelet will work to detect early signs of stress.)
