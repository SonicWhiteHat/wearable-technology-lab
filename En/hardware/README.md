# 🛠️ Hardware Development

Welcome to the **Hardware** section of the Wearable Technology Lab.  
This part focuses on designing, prototyping, and integrating the physical components that power our smart wearable devices.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build reliable, small, and efficient hardware for smart bracelets and other wearables.
- Ensure seamless communication between sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud-based systems.
- Optimize energy consumption for long-term usage.

---

## ⚙️ Key Technologies

- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino Nano, ESP32, STM32
- **Sensors**: Heart rate, temperature, motion (accelerometer/gyroscope), oxygen saturation
- **Communication**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi
- **Power Management**: Low-power design strategies and rechargeable batteries

## 🧩 Hardware Architecture

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors capture physiological signals.
2. **Processing Unit**: Microcontroller preprocesses and transmits data.
3. **Wireless Communication**: Data is sent to mobile app or cloud server via BLE/Wi-Fi.
4. **User Feedback**: Vibration motors, LEDs, or buzzers for real-time alerts.
