## 📊 Priority Management — Eisenhower Matrix

Managing tasks based on urgency and importance boosts efficiency.

|               | **Urgent**                  | **Not Urgent**              |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Important** | ✅ Do it now (High priority)  | 🧠 Plan to do it (Schedule)   |
| **Not Important** | 📨 Delegate it to someone else | 🗑️ Eliminate or ignore         |

**Simple Rule:**
- **Important + Urgent** → Act immediately.
- **Important + Not Urgent** → Schedule it carefully.
- **Not Important + Urgent** → Try to delegate.
- **Not Important + Not Urgent** → Avoid.
